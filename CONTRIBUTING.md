# Contribution guidelines
If you are interested in this project, you're welcome to contribute!

### General rules

Be sure your ideas follow the [vision](VISION.md). If unsure, open an issue and let's disuss about it! Maybe it's a new feature or way of doing things which can open new doors! Don't be shy and please welcome!

All contributions are handled via Pull Requests (PRs). Your PR _must_ target the `develop` branch. This is the place where we aggregate all upcoming changes for the next release of Localiser. Moreover, your PR _must_ provide a meaningful description of what it is about.

We suggest using [Gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model. If you are using SourceTree, follow [this tutorial](https://gist.github.com/gotev/59904ad1bb8984e7b93a83b4598e86fc) to setup GitFlow!

### Developer docs

Please visit [dev/README.md](dev/README.md) which contains a lot of useful stuff to develop Localiser. Is there something missing? Your first contribution may be adding some docs to help other developers in your situation!

### Issue fixes

Fixing issues is a good way to start contributing and getting used to the codebase! You may want to look at outstanding reported issues, or maybe you bumped into an issue that you found. In the latter case, please make sure you first open an issue in the issue tracker here on GitHub and indicate that you're working on a fix. This will give a chance to other contributors to chime in, and help tracking who's working on what in order to avoid duplicate work.

Once you believe the issue is fixed, make sure the tests pass (see above) then open a Pull Request.

Congratulations on contributing a fix! We love receiving new bug fixes and your help is very much welcomed.

### Code review

Having the best possible codebase is one of the goals of this project. If you know a certain thing can be written better, in more idiomatic python or which saves lines of code and improves performance, you're more than welcome to enhance the code. It's not necessary to add new things. Having a rock solid codebase, which is easy and straightforward to maintain is a must.

Congratulations on contributing a code review! We love discussing about code, design patterns and architecture and your help is very much welcomed.

### Documentation improvements

Have you found a lack in the documentation or in the examples, which can ease many of Localiser users? Do you have better suggestions for existing documentation! This is the same as code review and very much appreciated!
